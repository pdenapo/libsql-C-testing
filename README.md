# libsql-C-testing

This repository contains some C programs for testing the C bingdings for libsql.

To use it, first compile libsql from the sources using 

  cargo xtask build 

Then set the environment variables LIBSQL_PATH and LIBSQL_INCLUDE_PATH (addapted to your system). I use the script set_env.sh

  . ./set_env.sh
